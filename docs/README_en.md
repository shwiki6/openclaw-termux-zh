## What's New In v2.0.2

- Merges the setup stability fixes, the previous terminal-performance work, and current unpublished changes into this v2.0.2 package. Android build number is now `77`.
- Large RootFS / Node.js runtime archives are no longer bundled in the APK, bringing the universal APK down to about 45.96 MB and split APKs to about 27 MB.
- Bootstrap resource settings now live on a separate page, with GitHub `basic-resource` defaults plus separate URL/local-file fields for prebuilt RootFS, Ubuntu base RootFS, and Node.js.
- The first-run setup wizard now uses a small-icon header, a step timeline, and a tighter settings area, with localized bootstrap-resource and sample-config copy.
- Buffered terminal output refreshes across configure, onboarding, package install, Weixin install, and the regular terminal, reducing UI jank during verbose OpenClaw output.
- Reduced terminal scrollback from 10000 to 3000 lines to lower memory and rendering pressure.
- Interactive terminals now default to a lighter PRoot fast mode without the heavier SysV IPC compatibility flag.
- DNS preparation is centralized through `ProotDnsService.ensureReady()` instead of repeated per-screen fallback writes.
- Keeps armv7 Node.js compatibility, domestic DNS / Ubuntu mirror fallbacks, apt/dpkg directory preparation, and clearer PRoot failure summaries.
- Bundled sample configs now point to a test-friendly OpenAI-compatible provider so new users can verify the flow quickly.
- The local model page now explicitly warns that the current path is PRoot + llama.cpp + GGUF CPU, not Google AI Edge native GPU.

## Current Development Branch Changes

- The app brand has been changed to "小龙虾"; Android `applicationId`, `namespace`, and MethodChannel identifiers now use `com.openclaw.xlx`.
- First-run setup now follows the npm `openclaw@latest` stable release by default, while filtering prerelease tags such as beta, rc, test, and preview from the selectable version list.
- Runtime defaults in this branch target Ubuntu 24.04.3, Node.js 24.14.1 for arm64/x86_64, and Node.js 22.22.2 for armv7 compatibility.
- After setup, users can write an Android-recommended config that pre-creates local gateway settings, a random token, workspace defaults, node capability allowlists, and Web console settings; API Base URL, API Key, and model selection remain in the AI Providers page.
- Custom model providers now include an optional "Model Reasoning Strength" setting saved as `models.providers.<providerId>.models[0].thinking`, with `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `adaptive`, and `max` support.
